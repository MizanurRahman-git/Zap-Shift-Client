Zap Shift — Smart & Reliable Parcel Management Platform

Site Link: https://zap-shift-client-8310c.web.app

Zap Shift is a modern web-based parcel management platform designed to make sending and receiving parcels seamless, secure, and efficient. The system supports three core roles — User, Rider, and Admin, each with dedicated access control and responsibilities, ensuring a fully streamlined workflow from request to delivery.

With Zap Shift, any registered user can send parcels to any location while staying updated throughout the entire delivery process. Upon creating a delivery request, an available Rider within the sender’s area is assigned to collect the parcel and ensure timely delivery to the destination. Delivery charges are calculated dynamically based on destination and distance, where Riders earn 60% of the parcel fee, and Admins receive 40% — ensuring a fair and transparent earning structure.

The Admin dashboard provides complete operational visibility, allowing administrators to monitor rider availability, track parcel movement, verify delivery status, and maintain system-wide activity logs. Zap Shift features robust authentication, authorization, and data validation, ensuring only verified users can access the platform and perform actions according to their role.
